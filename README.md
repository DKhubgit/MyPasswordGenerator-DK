# Password Generator Starter Code

UCR Bootcamp provided the starter code!

# User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data\
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria\
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security\

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password  

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria  

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password  

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters  

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters  

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected  

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria  

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
